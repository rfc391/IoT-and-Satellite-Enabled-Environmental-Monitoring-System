# IoT and Satellite-Enabled Environmental Monitoring System

## Overview

This project combines IoT devices with satellite communication to enable **real-time environmental monitoring**. Designed with a modular architecture, it supports diverse applications such as climate research, disaster response, and precision agriculture. The system adheres to **ISO 27001/27701 standards**, aligns with **DARPA compliance**, and is **GDPR-compliant**.

## Key Features

- **IoT Sensor Data Ingestion**: Collects and processes temperature, humidity, and air quality data.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Utilizes AI/ML models for image processing, trend analysis, and anomaly detection.
- **Satellite Integration**: Ensures seamless data communication across remote locations.
- **Secure Architecture**:
  - Zero Trust framework via Cloudflare.
  - Quantum-safe encryption using QKD and PQC.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Enabled by Kafka, RabbitMQ, and NVIDIA Triton.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS-backed immutability with redundancy.
- **Scalability**: Supports containerized deployment using Docker/Kubernetes.
